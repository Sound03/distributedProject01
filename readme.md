REQUIREMENT:
-------------
- Python 3.10

- Environment- Pycharm

CONTENT:
---------
- **PART 1**- Implementing multi-threaded server that support UPLOAD,DOWNLOAD,DELETE and RENAME file operations.
------ 
  **Implementation**- 
1. Open DSpart1 directory for implementing part 1 
2. Run server.py on a terminal using the following command

       python server.py 
3. Simultanously open client.py on other terminal using the following command 

       python client.py 
4. Enter the required number operation(1.Upload 2.Download 3. Rename 4.Delete)
5. Enter the file name to perform the particular operation.

- **PART 2** Implementing the synchronised storage service
- ----------

**Implementation**

1. . Open DSpart2 directory for implementing part 2 
2. Run server.py on a terminal using the following command

       python server.py 
3. Simultanously open client.py on other terminal using the following command 

       python client.py 
4. Using file explorer, access the path where the client and server folders are stored and perform required operations.

- **PART 3** Implementing a computation server to support add(i,j) and sort (array A)operation using synchronous, asynchronous RPCs.
-------
**Implementaion**

SYNCHRONOUS
1. Open DSpart3 directory for implementing part 3 
2. Run server.py and server.py on different  terminals using the following command

       python server.py  
       python client.py 
3. The functions would return addition numbers and sorted array.

ASYNCHRONOUS 
1. Open DSpart3 directory for implementing part 3 
2. Run server.py and server.py on different  terminals using the following command

       python spserver.py  
       python spclient.py 
3. The functions would return addition numbers and sorted array.
